## Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from our families who suffer from severe illnesses like cancer. Throughout our lives, it has been very difficult for them to able to use everyday products because some contain dangerous materials like carcinogens-- which could be life-threatening to people. With this app, we want to make it more accessible for people to detect these harmful chemicals before they use them. 

## What it does 
Our app Vira searches the product for any potential carcinogenic chemicals in our database and reports it to the user. If the product contains harmful chemicals, our app recommends other clean products that do not contain harmful ingredients and are in a cheap price range. 


## How we built it 
To build our app, we used Flutterflow to construct the UI UX design, Firebase for the back end, and Pie Charm for the coding in Python. Through web scraping, we were able to search through the sites to find potential carcinogenic chemicals in the ingredients of products. We have also used a digital art app called Adobe Photoshop to create our own original app logo and some other images.

## Challenges we ran into 
This was our first hackathon and no one from our group had any experience with coding or programming. It was a challenge to use Flutterflow and Firebase for the first time because we spent a lot of time teaching ourselves the basics. Another challenge we ran into is our time management. In the beginning, we did not know how to manage our time, which is crucial to being able to complete our app in a timely manner.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
During our experience creating this app, we have surpassed many accomplishments that we are proud of. The first thing about our app that we are proud of is the UI UX design. We put a lot of care and attention into it; it was a lot of fun coming up with color schemes and organizing each page of our app. Even though it was very challenging to create the UI UX design, we are proud of how we were able to succeed in making the design despite the obstacles we faced.   

## What we learned 
Throughout this hackathon, we were able to learn the basics of Flutterflow and Firebase, and how to use those servers to build this app. We also learned about teamwork and how to communicate with each other efficiently, to be able to support each other and work together through times of stress. 

## What's next for Vira
In the future, we hope to expand this app to be able to get a better data modeling system and use AI modeling to predict side effects for a wider range of products.
